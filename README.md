## Inspiration

For the past year I've developed a huge passion for cryptocurrencies, at first being very interested in finances I liked the idea of bitcoin being a digital gold, a real store of value that was deflationary.

However in recent times i've become even more interested by the rise of NFTs, Cryptogaming and other Dapps that can improve our quality of life.
